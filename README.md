For my university project, Iâ€™ve decided to fully build a functional website centered around two key themes: AI and Construction. The site will explore how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the construction industry, from smart project management tools to automated machinery and data-driven design. By combining these two fields, the website will highlight the transformative impact of AI on construction processes, providing valuable insights and real-world applications.
